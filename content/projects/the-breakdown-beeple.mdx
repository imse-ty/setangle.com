summary: >
  A piece combining turntablism, jazz, and hip-hop with fast-paced animations.
  **All visuals, music, and sound were created entirely by the founder,
  Imsety.**


  This project was the perfect combination of my love for creating abstract
  stories and producing catchy beats to create music visuals and interactive
  experiences.

      I created a unique beat by blending a soulful oldie with some retro
      hip-hop beats. Sampling the classic Beyond The Sea by Ray Conniff and the
      Alphabet Aerobics by Blackalicious.

### Creating the beat and realizing the vision

What if you saw two turntables, like a DJ set, and one half of the screen was taken over by a color-coded sample? As the two vinyl records combine, you would see a bunch of fun shapes interacting with each other on beat.
