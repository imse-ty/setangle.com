## Kinetic explainer

The kinetic explainer was a blast to work on. We drew inspiration from vintage arcade games and synthwave imagery, crafting a visually engaging story. Each scene was meticulously planned and hand-animated, bringing a dynamic energy that perfectly captured the essence of SANSHU!

## Brand identity

Creating SANSHU's brand identity was all about balancing old and new. We held brainstorming sessions on Figma to explore different looks, combining modern elements with a retro twist.
