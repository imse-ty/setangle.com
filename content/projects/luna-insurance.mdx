summary: >
  LUNA came to us to produce a demo video highlighting their app for their booth
  at [InsureTech Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/company/insuretech-connect/)
  in Las Vegas. They also wanted to utilize the video as promotional content to
  build some hype. LUNA enables users to discover insurance quotes, communicate
  with agents, and manage their insurance needs all in a single app.
